## Project Idea
Our team is focused on enhancing bowling skills. Through our bowling simulator, we aim to instruct novice bowlers in the fundamentals of the game. The simulator emphasizes key skills such as throwing the ball straight, aiming accurately, and successfully hitting the pins.

## Bowling Simulator Manual
**How to Move:** 

To move in the virtual space, you must physically move your body. When setting up the bowling simulator and designating a virtual boundary, it is important to have enough physical space in your real environment. To ensure you have sufficient room to move around comfortably, aim to have space of at least 4 steps in each direction: forward, backward, right, and left.

**Controller Movements:**

To grab a ball, move your controller in the direction of the ball, aim your hand and grab it by pressing the controller’s grip button. The grip button is placed on the side of the controller and is where your middle finger should be positioned. Depending on your dominant hand, you can use either the right or left controller.

**How to Bowl:**

To begin the bowling tutorial, simply press the primary button on either controller (X on the left; A on the right). The System/AI will provide initial instructions on how to proceed. Once you've grabbed a bowling ball, additional instructions will be given to guide you through the process.
